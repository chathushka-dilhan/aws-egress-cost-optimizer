# AWS Egress Cost Optimizer: AI-Powered Data Transfer Anomaly Detection & Remediation

## Overview

In the dynamic world of cloud computing, managing and optimizing data transfer costs, especially egress (data leaving AWS), is a persistent challenge. These costs can be hazy, unpredictable, and often a significant portion of the AWS bill.

This sample solution provides an advanced, AI/ML-driven framework to proactively identify, analyze, and even remediate unexpected spikes in AWS data egress. By leveraging a suite of AWS services, including Amazon Bedrock and SageMaker, I have transformed reactive cost management into a proactive, intelligent, and continuously optimizing FinOps practice.
